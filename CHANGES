Work directory
- Work directory naming has been simplified to make it simpler for especially checkpointing

Updates from W. Guan:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/131

Commit Summary

1) allowRemoteInputs,
   When a site's storage is in down time, if this option is set, the site can still run es jobs which will get inputs files from other sites(based on rucio to select the sites). Before we did an es test when bnl dcache was in down time, the test failed because we were not allowed to get remote inputs files.

2) normalize objectstore as normal RSE.
In the new mover structure, objectstore is not a special storage anymore. With this patch, we can update agis to define es output/logs storages. I already tested it to run both es jobs and es merge jobs.

1. add allowRemoteInputs. If it's set, pilot will check local replicas at first. If there is no local replica, pilot will read/download remote replicas.
2. enable to use activity for es outputs.
pilot was designed to use special functions to call objectstores in es jobs. new updates make pilot be able to use activity in agis to use storages more than objectstores and different copytools.
3. fix mover part to be able to merge es files from normal storages.
4. fix objectstore sitemover to be able to generate surl for files which are in normal grid storages but not registered in rucio.

to avoid calling stageout function two times
add allowRemoteInputs option
update activity pes to es_events
fix mover to support allowRemoteInputs and normal RSE as es storage
update objectstore sitemover to support normal rse
normalize os as normal rse
add log when using associating storages
fix issues in normalizing objectstore as normal RSE
removing test logs
add log
fix stagout log part
fix objectstoreId when file is registerred

Updates from Taylor Childers:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/135

Commit Summary

I've changed two parts of the cmd line creation for the ATLAS job.

If the environment has RUCIO_ACCOUNT set, it overrides the default of 'pilot'.
The local site can override the Database setup by ATLASLocalRootBase by setting the environment variable 'PILOT_DB_LOCAL_SETUP_CMD'. This avoids having to edit the pilot directly for local environment changes.

- adding ability to change local database environment before transform is executed. Also added ability to override RUCIO_ACCOUNT via the environment

Updates from Wen Guan:

    copy jobMetrics-yoda.json to top working directory for ARC.
    ignore sqlite200 in ES logs copying(when copying logs from rank_* directory to pilot directory).
    update to download number of events from corecount to corecount*2
    update to support new mover in RunJobHpcEvent.py
    update to use storageId(rse id) instead of objectstoreId, in this case we can use normal grid storages.
    when normal stagein failed, ES will be able to try to stage in files from remote storages with rucio sitemover.
    stop eventservice when there are too many continuous stageout failures. 

Commit Summary

1. using storageId but fallback to bucket id if storageid is not available
2. only when storageId is set, objectstoresitemover will build replica.
3. implementation to support multiple buckets.
4. fix getSURL in objectstoresitemover to use pathConvention.
5. replace readpar to use new function. because readpar is reading old schedconf which can be different from the schedconfi the new mover is using.

Commit Summary

use storageid but fallback to bucket id if storageid is not available
fix to only buil replica url when storageId is set
multiple buckets implementation
fix pathConvention in stagein

Updates from Mario Lassnig/Frank Berghaus

Rucio now supports the DAV protocol. It uses the protocol to slightly modify it's behavior when talking to a strict DAV endpoint compared to a more relaxed HTTP 
endpoint. Integrating the DynaFed into ATLAS DDM requires Rucio to make this distinction. Davs protocol added to the pilot.

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/139

Commit Summary

  add DAVs to protocols supported by rucio

todo: rename pUtil.getExperiment to pUtil.getExperimentObject, correct import in SiteInformation

#### add new error codes 1217-1219 to proddb
Update prodDB for ERR_RUNJOBEXC : "Exception caught by runJob" -> "Exception caught by RunJob*" ? not necessary??
Added new error codes; 1224 (ERR_ESRECOVERABLE), 1225 (ERR_ESMERGERECOVERABLE) (PilotErrors)
