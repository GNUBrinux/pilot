Complete change log for the Pilot 1
-----------------------------------

68.0

General changes:
- Updated dump to pretty print written json dictionary, in writeJSON() (FileHandling)

Removal of remaining dq2 API usage:
- Deprecated and removed large parts of getTURLs() related to lcg-getturls, which also called getRSEType() and getRSE(), which in turn used the dq2 API (Mover)
- Removed isDPMSite(), not used any longer (Mover)
- Removed getRSEType(), not used any longer (Mover)
- Removed getRucioPath(), not used any longer (Mover, SiteMover)
- Removed getRucioFileList(), not used any longer (Mover)
- Cleaned up getPoolFileCatalog() a bit (Mover)

NOTE: getRSE() need to be rewritten, or logic changed to set the RSE, since it is used by all old site mover

Nightlies:
- Added .X to getCacheInfo() to fix a case where nightlies were not setup correctly. Requested by Johannes Elmsheuser (ATLASExperiment)

Benchmarking:
- Only executing benchmark tool once out of a hundred starts in shouldExecuteBenchmark() (ATLASSiteInformation)
- Created getJobReportFileName(), addToJobReport() (FileHandling)
- Created getBenchmarkFileName() (SiteInformation, ATLASSiteInformation)
- Created getBenchmarkDictionary() (JobLog)
- Created getBenchmarkSubprocess() (RunJob)
- Added benchmark process, running during stage-in (RunJob, RunJobEvent)
- Deprecated and removed unnecessary executeBenchmark() (SiteInformationm ATLASSiteInformation, Node)

Memory monitoring:
- Updated the memory monitor version to 21.0.18 in getUtilityCommand() (ATLASExperiment)

Copytools:
- Corrected logical bug when updating file state (direct_access -> remote_io) in stagein_real() (mover)
- Corrected loging bug when checking file states after transfer (direct_access -> remote_io) in get_data_new() (Mover)

Event Service:
- PREFETCHER IS ENABLED for late releases
- Added __yamplChannelNamePrefetcher, renamed __yamplChannelName to __yamplChannelNamePayload (RunJobEvent)
- Setting __yamplChannelNamePrefetcher in __init__() (RunJobEvent)
- Added prefetcher field to Job class (Job)
- Updated schemes for prefetcher and adding turl to fileState file in stagein_real() (mover)
- Created isPrefetcherReady(), setPrefetcherIsReady() (RunJobEvent)

Updates from Wen Guan:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/112

tar event outputs periodically
2)disable long monitor sleep on ND cloud because of failed 'send' (failed heartbeat)
fix to use different yampl channel name in yoda
payload may includes the same input files for more than one time, fix to stagein it only one time.
5)change updateEventRanges to support new version which supports to tar events periodically

1) normalized objectstore as a normal rse
2) optimized s3objectstore sitemover to have less HEAD operations: Dan reported that we had 4~5 times of 'HEAD' operations than 'GET' and 'PUT' operations. It caused load problems on objectstore.
3) updated rucio sitemover to support os upload
4) set objectstore keypair in environment, rucio site mover will use it.

Commit Summary

fix to remove tar/zip es files in the log
optimize s3objectstore sitemover to have less HEAD operation
update rucio sitemover to support os upload
normalize Objectstore as a normal RSE
set objectstore keypair in environment which rucio mover will use

Updates from Daniel Drizhuk:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/113

Introduced the new way of presenting HammerCloud parameter --overwriteQueuedata, added two more parameters: --useTestASetup and --useTestXRootD.

The proposed way for the new --overwriteQueuedata is to use common shell syntax.
In the new syntax --overwriteQueuedata is a multiargument parameter, that receives after it a set of parameters represented in key=value form. The set is ended when next parameter starts with - or with parameter --, that will be stripped.
The value in the parameter may be either a string or a valid JSON.
The escape sequences are posix shell compatible, so JSON should be probably wrapped into single quotes.
The argument string is parsed by shlex.

Examples of --overwriteQueuedata (assuming TRF is echo, lines do not include TRF):

Stripped end-of-parameters
The line this is --overwriteQueuedata key1 key2=null key3='{"a":1,"b":2}' -- test
will result in queuedata modification key1=True, key2=None, key3={a:1,b:2}
and command echo this is test

End-of-parameters is a dash-prefix of the next parameter
The line this is --overwriteQueuedata key1 key2=null key3='{"a":1,"b":2}' -test
will result in queuedata modification key1=True, key2=None, key3={a:1,b:2}
and command echo this is -test

Second occurrence and EOL as an end-of-parameters
this is --overwriteQueuedata key1 key2=null key3='{"a":1,"b":2}' -test --overwriteQueuedata key4
will result in queuedata modification key1=True, key2=None, key3={a:1,b:2}, key4=True
and command echo this is -test

Updates from Wen Guan:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/122

In athena 21.0.15, if we combine jps part with EVENtoHITS part in one block, athena will not be able to start. So we need to use a separate block like below to preExec jps part.
--preExec 'from AthenaMP.AthenaMPFlags import jobproperties as jps;jps.AthenaMPFlags.EventRangeChannel="EventService_EventRanges-9419a6ca-4de9-4fcf-9b7d-5e1045e998b2"' 'EVNTtoHITS:simFlags.SimBarcodeOffset.set_Value_and_Lock(200000)' 'EVNTtoHITS:simFlags.TRTRangeCut=30.0;simFlags.TightMuonStepping=True'
