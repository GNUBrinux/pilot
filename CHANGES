TODO: update pUtil::getStdoutDictionary() to support the tail of the last updated AthenaMP log file; also update PandaServerClient::updatePandaServer() to
take the latest log file and send it to the text indexer in debug mode (see Rod's mail on Nov. 24)

Memory monitoring updates:
- Calling __check_memory_usage() in monitoring loop, in monitor_job() (Monitor)
- Created merge_dictionaries() (pUtil)
- Now importing merge_dictionaries (PandaServerClient)

- Ignoring empty lFC paths from getLFCPath() call in getProperPaths()
- Protecting against empty lfcpaths in getUserLFCDir() (SiteMover)

Time-out changes:
- Protected against exitcode None being sent in run() (TimerCommand)

Logging changes:
- Added new logging module to distribution: Logger.py with code constributions from Wen Guan (logging) and Jose Caballero (formatting)

Update from Danila Oleynik, Taylor Childers:
- New modules: ArgoJob, RunJobArgo, BalsamJob, MessageInterface
- Updated RunJobFactory; replaced Mira with Argo
- Added functions to serialize ARGO messages: serialize(), deserialize(), convert_unicode_string() (pUtil)

Merged with Wen's version:
- Added EventStager module for HPC Nersc
- Added GetJob module for getting multiple jobs
- Update EventServerManager to let it run in a sub-process. Before it was running in the current process, in this case it cannot be switched to another job which is needed by multi-jobs Yoda.
- In EventServerManager add functions to handle AthenMP error messages.
- Update to use bulk event ranges updates to panda server
- Fix cases that all ranks of Yoda were killed when one rank finished.
- Update HPCManager to handle multi-jobs.
- Update Yoda database function to fix the bottleneck which was slow to update db changes
- Update Yoda Interaction module to fix the messages delay
- Update Yoda and Droid to handle multi-jobs
- Add Signal_block module in Yoda to make Yoda soft termination
- Update monitor module to monitor multi-jobs, terminate multi-jobs, handle multi-jobs logs and recover HPC jobs
- Restored is_secure variable which got lost in the merging process (S3ObjectstoreSiteMover)

REMOVE RunJobMira.py FROM DISTRIBUTION
ADD TO DISTRIBUTION: ArgoJob, RunJobArgo, BalsamJob

TODO:

Remove singletons:
- Change __experiment to experiment in Experiment classes
- Use super() in __init__() (ATLASExperiment)
- Same changes to SiteInformation classes

62.1?
Avoiding setting exit code 1008/65 when no jobs were downloaded in getJob(), requested by John Hover (pilot)

REMOVE OTHERSITEMOVER FROM DIST
HUSITEMOVER?

Prior to file registration (i.e. for US sites that still uses the pilot for file registrations), the pilot sets the LFC_HOST env variable; no longer needed for file
registrations using Rucio functions test with a job run in the US, BNL e.g. which still uses the pilot for file registrations

todo: remove the explicit usages of schedconfig.lfchost and replace with an experiment specific method (getFileCatalog())
todo: rename pUtil.getExperiment to pUtil.getExperimentObject, correct import in SiteInformation

#### add new error codes 1217-1219 to proddb
Update prodDB for ERR_RUNJOBEXC : "Exception caught by runJob" -> "Exception caught by RunJob*" ? not necessary??
Added new error codes; 1224 (ERR_ESRECOVERABLE), 1225 (ERR_ESMERGERECOVERABLE) (PilotErrors)
