69.0

setup not correct for analy jobs in getJobExecutionCommand(), addMAKEFLAGS called too late

timefloor



General changes:
- Created handleAdditionalOutFiles() to cleanup main function a bit (RunJob)
- Corrected error messages (grammatical) in stageout(), do_put_files() (mover)
- Removed useless lfchost from getFileTransferInfo() (Experiment)
- Removed useless lfchost from getAnalysisRunCommand() (ATLASExperiment)
- Removed sourcing of copysetup in getAnalysisRunCommand() (ATLASExperiment)
  Tadashi's comment: IIRC, it was required for some trfs to read input files directly from BNL dcache which was unavailable in login shell by default.
  (BNL queues have used the new movers for a while and schedconfig.copysetup has been set to OLDMOVERDEPRECATED with no reported problem)
- Removed deprecated function getSetupFromCopysetup() (Experiment)
- Removed deprecated function transferAdditionalCERNVMFiles() and its call (JobLog)
- Removed deprecated function transferAdditionalFile() and its call (JobLog)
- Removed deprecated variable transferAdditional from postJobTask() (JobLog)
- Removed deprecated usage of getChecksumCommand(), replaced with "adler32" string in createMetadataForOutput(), 2 times (JobLog)
- Removed deprecated usage of getChecksumCommand(), replaced with "adler32" string in getXML() (PandaServerClient)
- Removed deprecated usage of getChecksumCommand(), replaced with "adler32" string in createFileMetadata() (RunJob)
- Removed deprecated usage of getChecksumCommand(), replaced with "adler32" string in createFileMetadata(), createFileMetadata4EventRange() (RunJobEvent)
- Removed deprecated function getChecksumCommand() (pUtil)
- Removed getSiteMover() and its import in createMetadataForOutput() (JobLog)
- Using fixed time-out instead of time-out from old site movers in for looping stage-outs in __loopingJobKiller() and removed usage of getSiteMover() (Monitor)
- Removed usage of deprecated function getSiteMover() in getXML() (PandaServerClient)
- Removed deprecated use of file stager variables in getAnalysisRunCommand() (ATLASExperiment)
- Removed deprecated lfchost in updateRunCommandList() (RunJobUtilities)
- Added a new function for calculating adler32 (same as Harvester), calc_adler32() (SiteMover)

Work directory
- Work directory naming has been simplified to make it simpler for especially checkpointing
- Removed time stamp and panda id from job work directory in mkJobWorkdir() (Job)
- Removed process id and time stamp from site workdir in getWorkDir() (Site)

Memory monitor
- Created new getUtilityCommand() for Nordugrid since default function has problems with complex ND release (NordugridATLASExperiment)

Event Streaming Service
- Now waiting for Prefetcher to finish in __main__() (RunJobEvent)
- Using self.__usePrefetcher variable in adaptEventRanges(), if true add pfn field to event range (RunJobEvent)
- Renamed adaptEventRanges() to addPFNsToEventRanges() (RunJobEvent)
- Created addPFNToEventRange() (RunJobEvent)
- Added 'prefetch' support in get_input_files() (Job)
- Updated setUsePrefetcher() (RunJobEvent)

jobPars based payload setup:
- Added noExecStrCnv (Job)
- Added asetup boolean to getModernASetup() (ATLASExperiment)

ZIP_MAP support:
- Added zipmap data member (Job)
- Processing jobPars for ZIP_MAP info in new functions removeZipMapString() and populateZipMap() (Job)
- Created addArchivesToOutput() to update output file info for archives (Job)
- Created createArchives() used with ZIP_MAP info (RunJob)

Singularity support:
- Created new module (Singularity)

Updates from W. Guan:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/131

Commit Summary

1) allowRemoteInputs,
   When a site's storage is in down time, if this option is set, the site can still run es jobs which will get inputs files from other sites(based on rucio to select the sites). Before we did an es test when bnl dcache was in down time, the test failed because we were not allowed to get remote inputs files.

2) normalize objectstore as normal RSE.
In the new mover structure, objectstore is not a special storage anymore. With this patch, we can update agis to define es output/logs storages. I already tested it to run both es jobs and es merge jobs.

1. add allowRemoteInputs. If it's set, pilot will check local replicas at first. If there is no local replica, pilot will read/download remote replicas.
2. enable to use activity for es outputs.
pilot was designed to use special functions to call objectstores in es jobs. new updates make pilot be able to use activity in agis to use storages more than objectstores and different copytools.
3. fix mover part to be able to merge es files from normal storages.
4. fix objectstore sitemover to be able to generate surl for files which are in normal grid storages but not registered in rucio.

to avoid calling stageout function two times
add allowRemoteInputs option
update activity pes to es_events
fix mover to support allowRemoteInputs and normal RSE as es storage
update objectstore sitemover to support normal rse
normalize os as normal rse
add log when using associating storages
fix issues in normalizing objectstore as normal RSE
removing test logs
add log
fix stagout log part
fix objectstoreId when file is registerred

TODO:

OS log transfers:
[TODO: set bucket to -1 for failed log transfers in jobMetrics]

todo: remove the explicit usages of schedconfig.lfchost and replace with an experiment specific method (getFileCatalog())
todo: rename pUtil.getExperiment to pUtil.getExperimentObject, correct import in SiteInformation

#### add new error codes 1217-1219 to proddb
Update prodDB for ERR_RUNJOBEXC : "Exception caught by runJob" -> "Exception caught by RunJob*" ? not necessary??
Added new error codes; 1224 (ERR_ESRECOVERABLE), 1225 (ERR_ESMERGERECOVERABLE) (PilotErrors)
