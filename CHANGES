Complete change log for PanDA Pilot version PICARD
--------------------------------------------------


67.0:

General updates:

- Created __check_remaining_proxy() which is called every five minutes from monitor_job() and monitor_recovery_job() te ensure there is at least ten minutes left of the proxy (Monitor)

Bug fix for nightlies:

- Setting cacheVer to release for cases "," in job.homePackage or "rel_" in job.homePackage in getJobExecutionCommand() (ATLASExperiment)

Commit Summary

To support s3+rucio
Fixed bug

File Changes

M RunJobHpcEvent.py (2)
M objectstoreSiteMover.py (2)

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/84

1. To use 'pilot_killed' instead of 'pilot_failed' when a signal is caught
2. Fix event status when an AthenaMP error message is received. Normal athenaMP errors should not be 'fatal'. And currently we will not report fatal until we validate AthenaMP error reports

Commit Summary

update substatus when pilot is killed
fix event status

File Changes

M RunJobEvent.py (6)
M pUtil.py (2)

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/85

1. Close s3 connection in objectstore sitemover, to avoid too many open connections
2. Download events before starting athenaMP (fail immediately if no events available so not to waste time with starting up AthenaMP)

Commit Summary

close os connections
download events before startAthenaMP

File Changes

M RunJobEvent.py (28)
M S3ObjectstoreSiteMover.py (9)

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/86

1) In gfal sitemover, now using 'file:///path' instead of 'file:path'.
2) Set corecount before setup, because in preemption jobs, jobs are not preempted before reporting corecount. 
3) Send heartbeat to panda when job state is changed.

Commit Summary

set corecount before setup
send heartbeat to panda when job state changes
in gfal, to use file:///

- Ignoring lsm checksum error in stageOut() (movers/base)
- Created updateRunCommand() used by __main__() (RunJobEvent)
- Removed deprecated function getFileInDataset() (SiteMover)

[ Does not work, reverted to old function
Memory monitor updates

- Switched to new setup using release 21, getUtilityCommand(). Requested by Johannes Elmsheuser (ATLASExperiment)
]

Event service changes:

- Created __usePrefetcher, usePrefetcher(), setUsePrefetcher() (RunJobEvent)
- Calling setUsePrefetcher() from __main__() (RunJobEvent)

Nightlies setup changes:

- Created isNightliesRelease() (ATLASExperiment)
- Using isNightliesRelease instead of looking for rel_N in the homePackage in eight places (ATLASExperiment)
- Rewrote extractRelN() to extractNightliesTimestamp() (ATLASExperiment)

Tracing report update:

- Now setting taskID in getInitialTracingReport() (Mover)
- Sending job.taskID to getInitialTracingReport() from 4 places (Mover)
 
Updates from Wen Guan:

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/94

Commit Summary

File Changes

M GFAL2SiteMover.py (2)
M movers/base.py (17)

  https://github.com/PanDAWMS/pilot/pull/101

Old function would cause the monitor process to kill runjobevent process. as a result, the final status would not be set correctly.
new way will stop athenamp softly. let runjobevent have time to set the final state.

Commit Summary

Soft stop athenamp

67.5

BENCHMARK ON




General changes:

- Added call to pUtil.getJobStatus() in getNewJob(). After job has been downloaded, check with the PanDA server that the job is not already in a running state. This can happen due to a bug on the batch system side on Nordugrud resources. Requested by Andrej Filipcic, David Cameron
- Removed negation of id number sent to os.killpg() in killProcesses(). Requested by Rod Walker (processes)

Benchmarks:

- Added pdict argument to executeBenchmark() (SiteInformation, ATLASSiteInformation)
- Added cloud argument to getBenchmarkDictionary(), sent from runMain() (node, pilot)
- Created executeBenchmarks(), new getBenchmarkDictionary(). Added benchmarks private data member (Node)
- Created getBenchmarkDictionary(), updated executeBenchmarks(), added self.__benchmarks (SiteInformation, ATLASSiteInformation)

Hardcoded pandaserver urls:

- Removed hardcoded pandaserver url from .. (note: cannot currently remove hardcoded url for S3 secret key downloads since keys are only known to pandaserver and not any dev server)
- Added new argument url to downloadEventRanges(), updateEventRanges() (EventRanges)
- Setting PanDA server url in RunJob* argument list in getSubprocessArguments() (Experiment)
- Added -W server url argument in argumentParser() (RunJob)
