Disk space check           : OK
Pilot init dir in pUtil    : OK
Cleaner                    : ? test at UTA, lots of old tmp garbage there
Looping job killer         : BROKEN - fixed? Make sure no more 1112 pilot exceptions due to looping jobs
User analysis job          : Testing at ANALY_MWT2_SL6 (FAX test below) OK
prun                       : Test with Hello World example, then via HC?
Multi-job loop             : Testing at UTA_PAUL_TEST, two queued jobs: OK (problems fixed, monitor_job() now returns exit info properly)
Job recovery               : Test at UTA_PAUL_TEST
FAX                        : Testing at ANALY_MWT2_SL6, broken LSM: OK (real test with RC jobs)

Secondary log transfer     : Repeat object-store test
Multi-trf                  : Ask Andrej, combine with Nordugrid test?

glExec                     : Hand over preliminary code when a few more of the other tests are done
RC tests, glExec           : Ask HC team to prepare RC tests when Eddie has confirmed that glExec still works
Subprocess selection       : (is runEvent selected properly after last merge?), test with testEventService-UTA.py

Additional test of recently added features

Job def download for a maximum of N seconds : (set getjobmaxtime)
